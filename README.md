Future Improvements:

This application was written early into development career, so improvements are mostly architecture-oriented:

-Open websites in webview, rather than forcing user into chrome browser
-Store music in remote database, to be downloaded/streamed into local file structure upon first play of the app, with Room Database persistence being used to point to location of each song file. This should drastically reduce download size of application
-Create database service class to deal with above behavior
-Convert CustomViews to Fragments to deal with lifecycle/orientation changes
-Convert RelativeLayouts into ConstraintLayouts
